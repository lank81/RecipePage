## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This one was a little tougher as there was a lot of styling I haven't done before.  A lot if it stemmed around Lists and their styling.  I was really happy with finishing this one though as it's a style/site I'd love to do.  As time goes on I'm looking forward to gaining a greater understanding of styles and responsive web design.
